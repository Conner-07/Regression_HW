The point of this assignment/script is to determine the disease progression of diabetes using 3 distinct regression ML models. The model types include Random Forrest Regressor, 
Linear Regression, and Support Vector Regression. 

Using the sklearn database, each individual model is trained with 80% of available data, with the remaining data being used to test the model on novel information. 

sklearn models were used, employing methods such as fit and predict. Different metrics were used to analyze the models abilities such as r2_score, mean_squared_error, and explained_variance_score
